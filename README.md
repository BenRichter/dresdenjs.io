# dresdenjs.io 

This is the repository for the web site of the Dresden JavaScript MeetUp mysteriously called [DresdenJS](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/DresdenJS-io-JavaScript-User-Group/). The main web site is [http://dresdenjs.io](http://dresdenjs.io) (we are looking for a sponsor or better some clever human to incorporate lets-encrypt-magic for a proper SSL certificate).

It gets automatically deployed via GitHub pages via TravisCI - for that to work you *must* commit to *master*! If you want to fix / edit something on it - or a presenter yourself; send in a PR (against *master*)and we might reward youw ith collaborator access. From cats for cats. We are made by the people!

## Build & development

Run (good-olde) `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. Of course you need nodejs and some dusty NodeJS 4.8 (`nvm use 4.8`) accompanied by a *global* `grunt` (`npm install grunt-cli -g`)

## Get involved!
If you have any ideas for DresdenJS, don't hesitate to contact us at [info@dresdenjs.io](info@dresdenjs.io)

## Sponsors
Currently we have no real sponsors - and the sloths @[Zalari](https://github.com/zalari) are too busy coming up with a nice logo...

 // TODO: add super-fancy LOGO here for Zalari
